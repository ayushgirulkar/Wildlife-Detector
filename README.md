# Wildlife-Detector


Wildlife Detection Website 🌳🦌🔥

This is a basic Wildlife Detection Website created for forest area monitoring.
It detects critical events such as animal hunting, fire, and elephant movement.
I built this project for learning and understanding concepts of YOLOv8, HTML, CSS, and Flask.
I also used ChatGPT whenever I needed assistance during development.


🛠️ Technologies Used
Flask (Backend Framework)

YOLOv8 (Object Detection Model)

HTML / CSS (Frontend)

MySQL (Database)


📜 Features
Admin Panel

Admin can upload images or videos of forest events (e.g., fire, animal sightings).

After uploading, the system runs detection using the trained YOLOv8 model.

Event Detection and Alert

Automatically detects events like fire, animal hunting, and elephant movement.

Displays the event's location on a map (location is fetched based on the IP address of the uploading device).

Shows notifications after detection with timestamp and event details.


🚀 Purpose
This project was developed for educational purposes, to practice and understand:

Object detection with YOLOv8

Building a web application with Flask

Frontend styling with HTML/CSS

Storing and displaying event data using MySQL
